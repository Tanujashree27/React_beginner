ðŸ“– About React
React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building fast and interactive user interfaces. It uses a component-based architecture and a virtual DOM for efficient rendering. React allows developers to create reusable UI elements, manage dynamic data with hooks like useState and useEffect, and build single-page applications (SPAs) with ease.
